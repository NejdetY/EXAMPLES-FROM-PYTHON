Question4: Create a "Vehicle" class in Python. Make sure this class has the following properties:

Features:
"make" (Brand of vehicle)
"model" (Vehicle model)
"year" (Year of manufacture of the vehicle)
Create a "Vehicle" class and create two derived subclasses, "Off-Road Vehicle" (SUV) and "SportsCar" classes.

The "Off-Road Vehicle" class inherits from the "Vehicle" class and adds an additional "four_wheel drive" feature.
Let the "SportCar" class inherit from the "Vehicle" class and add a "max_speed" property.
Create an instance of each class, determine its properties, and write a program to display these properties.


class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, make,model, year):
        self.make=make
        self.model=model
        self.year=year

    def display_info(self):
        return f"Make: {self.make}, Model:{self.model}, Year:{self.year}"


class OffRoad(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, make, model,year, four_wheel_drive):
        super().__init__(make, model,year)
        self.four_wheel_drive=four_wheel_drive

    def display_info(self):
        base_info=super().display_info()
        return f"{base_info}, Four-Wheel Drive:{'Yes' if self.four_wheel_drive else 'No'}"

class SportsCar(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self,make, model, year, max_speed):
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
        self.max_speed=max_speed

    def display_info(self):
        base_info=super().display_info()
        return f"{base_info}, Max Speed:{self.max_speed} km/h"
off_road_vehicle=OffRoad(make="Jeep", model="Wrangler", year=2002, four_wheel_drive=True)

sports_car=SportsCar(make="Honda", model="civic", year=2004, max_speed=120)

print("Off-Road Vehichle information:")
print(off_road_vehicle.display_info())

print("\nSports Car Information:")
print(sports_car.display_info())
